## Overview

This program runs a code written in C through Java using Java Native Interface (JNI). This results in a significantly lesser execution time as compared to the execution time when the same code is written in Java.

## Results

Below are the outputs of codes written in Java and C (usage of JNI):
(for an integer array of 8 elements)
